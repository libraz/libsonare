# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v1.2.1 (2026-05-27)

### Bindings & API

- Added a `StreamingRetune` WASM binding (prepare/reset/setConfig/config/
  grainSize/processMono) backed by `editing/voice_changer/streaming_retune.h`,
  with TypeScript types and Vitest coverage.

### CLI

- Added VQT, mel-to-audio/MFCC-to-audio (Griffin-Lim) reconstruction, meter,
  clipping, dynamic-range, stereo, and phase analysis commands.
- Added normalize, gain, fade, biquad filter, and resample processing commands.
- Added tone, chirp, and clicks synthesis generators.

### CI

- Dropped `windows-latest` from the native build matrix; MSVC source-portability
  fixes are retained so building from source on Windows still works.

## v1.2.0 (2026-05-26)

### Mixing engine

- Added the mixing engine surface: channel strips, pan modes, width controls,
  sends, FX buses, goniometer/true-peak metering, JSON scene presets, and
  offline stereo rendering.
- Added channel-strip input trim, insert gain scale/output gain/pan controls,
  external sidechain parameters, bus insert hosting, graph PDC, and scene-loaded
  persistent mixer APIs.
- Added hold and s-curve automation shapes plus per-target insert/send lanes.
- Added automation lanes, scene/preset API, and an AudioWorklet bridge.
- Added a native mixing benchmark target and expanded CI coverage for macOS and
  Windows native builds.
- Added mixing QA coverage for golden hashes, no-allocation process checks,
  graph routing/PDC integration, meter/goniometer snapshots, and CLI/binding
  smoke tests.

### Mastering engine

- Added a monitor bus output with automation telemetry diagnostics and
  sample-accurate, bind-feedback automation routing.
- Made the dynamics processors real-time-safe via channel pre-allocation, with a
  centralised channel preallocation limit.
- Resolved loudness targets per streaming platform and honoured platform
  normalisation.
- Registered ducking and loudnessOptimize processors and added a de-esser
  bandpass Q with stereo preservation.
- Added assistant/profile/streaming-preview JSON output and a configurable
  speech mono-maker amount.

### Analysis & features

- Added a cosine-similarity mode to the tempogram.
- Derived streaming-retune grain size from the sample rate.
- Improved DSP correctness for iSTFT windowing, chroma folding, K-weighting,
  spectral/VQT/iirt/melody/CQT features, and percentile interpolation (now
  matching NumPy's linear interpolation).

### Bindings & API

- Exposed mixing presets and rendering through C, Python, Node, WASM, and CLI
  APIs.
- Exposed mastering assistant/profile/preview, ducking, streaming chord/pattern
  progression, stream window/output-format config, and inverse Mel/MFCC
  reconstruction across the C, Node, and WASM bindings.

### Fixes

- Preserved per-channel mastering state on channel-count change and tightened
  config validation.
- Made engine counters and smoothing atomic and excluded shared strips.
- Fixed exact cumulative sample counting and bounded chroma history in the
  streaming analyzer.
- Dropped the spurious sidechain reset in the Node streaming equalizer.

### Internal

- Centralised numeric constants in `util/constants.h` and routed IIR,
  crossover, and mastering filters through shared biquad/loudness helpers.
- Fixed the stale `SONARE_VERSION_*` macros in `sonare.h` so the runtime
  `version()` reports the correct value.
