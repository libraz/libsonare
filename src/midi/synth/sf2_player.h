/// @brief Multitimbral (16-part) SoundFont 2 player implementing
///        MidiInstrument: (bank, program) -> preset resolution, layered
///        preset/instrument zone matching, the shared voice pool with
///        deterministic stealing, BuiltinSynth-compatible channel-mode CC
///        semantics (CC64 sustain, CC120/121/123), and the GS effect bus
///        (reverb / chorus / delay send-returns + per-part insert slot).
///
/// One Sf2Player instance receives all 16 MIDI channels (GS multitimbral
/// convention); channel 10 (index 9) resolves percussion via bank 128.
/// Programs no SoundFont preset covers — including the no-SoundFont case —
/// fall back to the NativeSynth GM bank (the data-free floor), so an
/// arrangement never bounces silent because of missing data.
/// Internally process() runs a 16-part bus graph in fixed-size chunks:
/// voices accumulate into their part bus (insert processing) and into the
/// system effect send buses (CC91/93/94 + zone send generators); the wet
/// returns are summed with the dry mix. The effect bodies reuse the existing
/// effects/ suite and only exist when the FX library is built
/// (SONARE_MIDI_WITH_FX); otherwise the player renders dry.
///
/// RT contract (MidiInstrument): set_soundfont() and prepare() run on the
/// CONTROL thread and are the only allocating calls; on_event()/process()
/// are allocation-free, lock-free and IO-free. The Sf2File is shared
/// read-only with the audio thread.
///
/// Determinism: no RNG, no wall clock; voice stealing, effects and rendering
/// are bit-identical for identical event streams within one build.
